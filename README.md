# BCI-Audiovisual-Speech
A collection of anonymised data and relevant code used for the implementation of Bayesian Casual Inference in my dissertation project.

In the project we implemented Bayesian Causal Inference to model multisensory integration with temporally asynchronous audiovisual speech.

The code is an adaptation of the model from Magnotti, Ma & Beauchamp (2013), and the computational strategies outlined in Wozny et al., (2010).
