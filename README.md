A collection of anonymised data and relevant code used for the implementation of Bayesian Casual Inference in my dissertation project.

In the project I will implement a computational model, Bayesian Causal Inference, to model multisensory integration with temporally asynchronous sensory signals.

The code is an adaptation of the model from Magnotti, Ma & Beauchamp (2013), but implemented in Python --> https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00798

Here's a link to the google colab file where I'm currently writing the model -->
