A collection of anonymised data and relevant code used for the implementation of Bayesian Casual Inference in my dissertation project.

In the project I will implement a computational model, Bayesian Causal Inference, to model multisensory integration with temporally asynchronous sensory signals.

The code is an adaptation of the original code from Magnotti, Ma & Beauchamp (2013) --> https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00798

Here's a link to the google colab file where I'm currently writing the model --> https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-Y42Ok8EaWKJEUVZHiY7oi-dl_hAJYS8?usp=sharing
